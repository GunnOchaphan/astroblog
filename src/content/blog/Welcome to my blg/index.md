after my work I usually just binge youtube or read about something on the internet. But I got bored. The reason being that content nowadays is mostly bad. It just generic and has no character. You dont get anything out of it.

But it's also the reason I started looking for content that goes deeper than usual

So what are some topics I'm looking into right now.

- Pokemon Trading Card Invsting (yes, guys. People invest in cards)
- Warhammer 40k
- Oil well appraisal
- Short investing publication
- and keep going

I'll also write something of my own, including: Blogging and content creation, Aviation, Public Transportation Investigation, etc. 

I read every emails or messages, so feel free to reach out to me. Everyone is welcome.
